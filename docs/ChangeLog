This file contains a list of changes and additions to the API/ABI that
might affect cross-OS compatibility or otherwise impact OS
implementations, in particular any changes to hypervisor interfaces and
the inter-domain protocols. When making such a change you are expected
to add it here (bonus points for a link to fuller documentation). New
entries should be part of the patch making the change (so the history of
this file will give the relevant changeset), added to the top of the
file, and in a format like:

Xen 3.4 release (and later)
---------------------------

This file not updated.

Xen 3.3 release
---------------

17974: PHYSDEVOP_manage_pci_add/PHYSDEVOP_manage_pci_remove
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/183ca809e1d7

17903: Add greater than 16 xvd device availability
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/0728459b3c8d

The tools can now attach a disk of the form:
(1<<28) | (device<<8) | partition
to support many more xvd disks and up to 256 partitions.
The linux guest frontend has been expanded to support
this new construct, while legacy guests should just ignore it.
	
17538: Add XENPF_set_processor_pminfo
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/5bb9093eb0e9

17537: Add MSI support
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/ad55c06c9bbc

17524: Add DOMCTL_set_cpuid to configure guest CPUID on x86 systems.
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/18727843db60

17336: Add platform capabilities field to XEN_SYSCTL_physinfo
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/250606290439

17289: PV framebuffer dynamic resolution facility
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/d97e61001d81

Guest may send XENFB_TYPE_RESIZE if feature-resize=1 in
xenstore of the backend VNC server. VNC server code sets
feature-resize if it can handle the resize request.

16857: XS_SET_TARGET
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/26fc953a89bb

New xenstore command to allow an arbitrary domain to inherit the
privileges of another (in addition to its own).

16856: XEN_DOMCTL_set_target
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/cff4c8a1aa28

New domctl command to give an arbitrary domain dom0-magnitude privileges
over an arbitrary other.

16725: XENFEAT_mmu_pt_update_reserve_ad
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/847bc9b19c48

New feature flag available via the version hypercall indicates whether the
Xen host supports MMU_PT_UPDATE_PRESERVE_AD for this guest.

16724: CPUID feature flag for MMU_PT_UPDATE_PRESERVE_AD hypercall
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/a66bdc82d8fa

The x86 CPUID_4000_0002_ECX[0] flag indicates whether the Xen host
supports MMU_PT_UPDATE_PRESERVE_AD for this guest.

16718: MMU_PT_UPDATE_PRESERVE_AD
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/fba4e7357744

A subcommand of the x86-only mmu_update() hypercall to allow batched
updates of pagetable entries, while atomically preserving the current
status of accessed and dirty bits in each entry.

Xen 3.2 release
---------------

16592: XEN_DOMCTL_test_assign_device
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/ef83b50fc4a4

Test VT-d device assignability in xend. If VT-d is not enabled, or the
device is not exist, or the device has already been assigned to other
domain, it fails and quits the domain creation.

16549: GNTST_address_too_big
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/baf90ee3c1da 

32-on-64 related additional error return.

16512: XEN_DOMCTL_set_opt_feature
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/1de4e5056394

Allows the domain builder to set optimization features for a guest. This
is currently only used by the IA64 domain builder to identify identity
mapped regions based on the guest_os_type specified in the domain config
file. Other architectures may extend this domctl to enable features
specific to their architecture.

16504: flush cache disk op
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/ebfb3b26010d 

Adds a BLKIF_OP_FLUSH_DISKCACHE request. The backend is expected to ask
underlying storage to flush its cache upon receiving this request.
Backend advertises availability via 'feature-flush-cache' xenstore node.
Needed for correct behaviour of disk-cache-aware filesystems such as
ZFS.

16425: multicast notifications
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/d3041196ae69 

Adds XEN_NETIF_EXTRA_TYPE_MCAST_ADD and XEN_NETIF_EXTRA_TYPE_MCAST_DEL
operations to the networking driver, which it uses to request multicast
addresses it's interested in. Available if the backend has
'feature-multicast-control', requested by the frontend with
'request-multicast-control'. Used by Solaris: this avoids having to
always put the backend's underlying networking device into promiscuous
mode.

16402: gnttab page attributes
http://xenbits.xensource.com/xen-unstable.hg?rev/2e5d922b7ee3 

Adds new grant tab flags for table entries. 

Older changes are not recorded further.
