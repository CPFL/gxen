=head1 NAME

/etc/xen/xl.conf - XL Global/Host Configuration 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<xl.conf> file allows configuration of hostwide C<xl> toolstack
options.

For details of per-domain configuration options please see
L<xl.cfg(5)>.

=head1 SYNTAX

The config file consists of a series of C<KEY=VALUE> pairs.

A value C<VALUE> is one of:

=over 4

=item B<"STRING">

A string, surrounded by either single or double quotes.

=item B<NUMBER>

A number, in either decimal, octal (using a C<0> prefix) or
hexadecimal (using an C<0x> prefix).

=item B<BOOLEAN>

A C<NUMBER> interpreted as C<False> (C<0>) or C<True> (any other
value).

=item B<[ VALUE, VALUE, ... ]>

A list of C<VALUES> of the above types. Lists are homogeneous and are
not nested.

=back

The semantics of each C<KEY> defines which form of C<VALUE> is required.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<autoballoon=BOOLEAN>

If disabled then C<xl> will not attempt to reduce the amount of memory
assigned to domain 0 in order to create free memory when starting a
new domain. You should set this if you use the C<dom0_mem> hypervisor
command line to reduce the amount of memory given to domain 0 by
default.

Default: C<1>

=item B<run_hotplug_scripts=BOOLEAN>

If disabled hotplug scripts will be called from udev, as it used to
be in the previous releases. With the default option, hotplug scripts
will be launched by xl directly.

Default: C<1>

=item B<lockfile="PATH">

Sets the path to the lock file used by xl to serialise certain
operations (primarily domain creation).

Default: C</var/lock/xl>

=item B<vifscript="PATH">

Configures the default hotplug script used by virtual network devices.

Default: C</etc/xen/scripts/vif-bridge>

=item B<defaultbridge="NAME">

Configures the default bridge to set for virtual network devices.

Default: C<xenbr0>

=item B<output_format="json|sxp">

Configures the default output format used by xl when printing "machine
readable" information. The default is to use the C<JSON>
L<http://www.json.org/> syntax. However for compatibility with the
previous C<xm> toolstack this can be configured to use the old C<SXP>
(S-Expression-like) syntax instead.

Default: C<json>

=item B<blkdev_start="NAME">

Configures the name of the first block device to be used for temporary
block device allocations by the toolstack.
The default choice is "xvda".
