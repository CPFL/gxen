 * outbuf  - output buffer
 * posp    - if non-null, input position (number of bytes read) will be
 *           returned here
 * error   - error reporting function
 *
 * If len != 0, inbuf should contain all the necessary input data, and fill
 * should be NULL
 * If len = 0, inbuf can be NULL, in which case the decompressor will allocate
 * the input buffer.  If inbuf != NULL it must be at least XXX_IOBUF_SIZE bytes.
 * fill will be called (repeatedly...) to read data, at most XXX_IOBUF_SIZE
 * bytes should be read per call.  Replace XXX with the appropriate decompressor
 * name, i.e. LZMA_IOBUF_SIZE.
 *
 * If flush = NULL, outbuf must be large enough to buffer all the expected
 * output.  If flush != NULL, the output buffer will be allocated by the
 * decompressor (outbuf = NULL), and the flush function will be called to
 * flush the output buffer at the appropriate time (decompressor and stream
 * dependent).
