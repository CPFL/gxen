	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	select VIRTIO
	select VIRTIO_RING
	---help---
	  This drivers provides support for virtio based paravirtual device
	  drivers over PCI.  This requires that your VMM has appropriate PCI
	  virtio backends.  Most QEMU based VMMs should support these devices
	  (like KVM or Xen).

	  Currently, the ABI is not considered stable so there is no guarantee
	  that this version of the driver will work with your VMM.

	  If unsure, say M.

config VIRTIO_BALLOON
	tristate "Virtio balloon driver (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	select VIRTIO
	select VIRTIO_RING
	---help---
	 This driver supports increasing and decreasing the amount
	 of memory within a KVM guest.

	 If unsure, say M.

 config VIRTIO_MMIO
 	tristate "Platform bus driver for memory mapped virtio devices (EXPERIMENTAL)"
 	depends on HAS_IOMEM && EXPERIMENTAL
 	select VIRTIO
 	select VIRTIO_RING
 	---help---
 	 This drivers provides support for memory mapped virtio
	 platform device driver.

 	 If unsure, say N.

config VIRTIO_MMIO_CMDLINE_DEVICES
	bool "Memory mapped virtio devices parameter parsing"
	depends on VIRTIO_MMIO
	---help---
	 Allow virtio-mmio devices instantiation via the kernel command line
	 or module parameters. Be aware that using incorrect parameters (base
	 address in particular) can crash your system - you have been warned.
	 See Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt for details.

	 If unsure, say 'N'.
