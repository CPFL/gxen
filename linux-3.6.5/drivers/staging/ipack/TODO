Introduction
============

These drivers add support for IndustryPack devices: carrier and IP module
boards.

The ipack driver is just an abstraction of the bus providing the common
operations between the two kind of boards.

TODO
====

TPCI-200
--------

* It has a linked list with the tpci200 devices it is managing. Get rid of it
  and use driver_for_each_device() instead.

IP-OCTAL
--------

* It has a linked list which saves the devices it is currently
  managing. It should use the driver_for_each_device() function. It is not there
  due to the impossibility of using container_of macro to recover the
  corresponding "struct ipoctal" because the attribute "struct ipack_device" is
  a pointer. This code should be refactored.

Ipack
-----

* The structures and API exported can be improved a lot. For example, the
  way to unregistering IP module devices, doing the IP module driver a call to
  remove_device() to notify the carrier driver, or the opposite with the call to
  the ipack_driver_ops' remove() function could be improved.
