Description
-----------

The INA219 is a high-side current shunt and power monitor with an I2C
interface. The INA219 monitors both shunt drop and supply voltage, with
programmable conversion times and filtering.

The INA226 is a current shunt and power monitor with an I2C interface.
The INA226 monitors both a shunt voltage drop and bus supply voltage.

The shunt value in micro-ohms can be set via platform data.
