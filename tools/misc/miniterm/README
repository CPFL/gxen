This is a modified version of the miniterm program distributed as part
of the Linux Programmer's Guide (LPG) by Sven Goldt.

It is intended to be used as a dumb raw terminal for debugging Xen
machines over the serial line.

By default it will connect to COM1 (/dev/ttyS0) at 115200 baud.
These options can be modified as follows:
 miniterm [-b<baudrate>] [-d<devicename>]

'ctrl-b' quits miniterm.
