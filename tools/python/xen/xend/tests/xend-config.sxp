# To bridge network traffic, like this:
#
#
# dom0: ----------------- bridge -> real eth0 -> the network
#                            |
# domU: fake eth0 -> vifN.0 -+
#
# use
#
# (network-script network-bridge)
#
# Your default ethernet device is used as the outgoing interface, by default. 
# To use a different one (e.g. eth1) use
#
# (network-script 'network-bridge netdev=eth1')
#
# The bridge is named xenbr0, by default.  To rename the bridge, use
#
# (network-script 'network-bridge bridge=<name>')
#
# It is possible to use the network-bridge script in more complicated
# scenarios, such as having two outgoing interfaces, with two bridges, and
# two fake interfaces per guest domain.  To do things like this, write
# yourself a wrapper script, and call network-bridge from it, as appropriate.
#
(network-script network-bridge)

# The script used to control virtual interfaces.  This can be overridden on a
# per-vif basis when creating a domain or a configuring a new vif.  The
# vif-bridge script is designed for use with the network-bridge script, or
# similar configurations.
#
# If you have overridden the bridge name using
# (network-script 'network-bridge bridge=<name>') then you may wish to do the
# same here.  The bridge name can also be set when creating a domain or
# configuring a new vif, but a value specified here would act as a default.
#
# If you are using only one bridge, the vif-bridge script will discover that,
# so there is no need to specify it explicitly.
