Xen MCE test suite
---------------

The Xen MCE test suite is a collection of tools and test scripts for
testing the Xen MCE processing features. The goal is to cover
most Xen MCE processing code paths and features with automation tests.


In the Package
--------------

Here is a short description of what is included in the package

README
	This is document

Makefile
	For compile

cases/*
	Contains all test cases, which may be organized in sub-directories, 
	the interface of test case is a shell script under cases/, such as:
	   -- cases/srao_mem/dom0/cases.sh

config/*
	Contains test configuration files, which specifies the parameters 
	for test cases, etc.

lib/*
	Contains some shell scripts, in which some common shell
	functions and variable definitions are defined to be used by
	test cases.

tools/*
	Tools used by MCE test suites, now only xen-mceinj tool.

results/
	When test is done, the test result will be placed in this
	directory, test results	of various cases may be in corresponding 
	directory. 
	For example, files in
	    results/srao_mem_dom0/result
	is the result for test case cases/srao_mem/dom0/cases.sh, there will
	be 3 result conditions: PASSED/FAILED/NORESULT.
		results/<test_case>/testlog   #the test log during testing
		results/<test_case>/mcelog    #mcelog output during testing
		results/<test_case>/xenlog    #Xen log during testing
		results/<test_case>/gklog     #VM guest kernel log during testing
		results/<test_case>/guest_config   #config file used to create guest


Test Instruction
----------------

1.	make sure you have a dom0 with mce support
	CONFIG_X86_MCE=y
	CONFIG_X86_MCE_INTEL=y
	CONFIG_X86_MCE_AMD=y
	CONFIG_X86_MCE_THRESHOLD=y
	CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT=y

2.	run system at xen and start xend. A installed guest image is
	necessary when do guest MCE error injection.
3.	compile tools that used to test. in mce-test, $make.
	Note: make sure compile xen/tools before do this step
4.	run test cases that you want.
	e.g. $sh cases/srao_mem/dom0/cases.sh -d 0 -p 0x0200 -c 2 -t 1
5.	get test result in results directory


Notes
----------------
All test cases fake a error and inject this error in 0x180020, For Xen
test cases(e.g. cases/srao_mem/xen/cases.sh), error happen on every page 
may cause a Xen panic.
