Notes on running this test suite:

To run the test suite, run "make check".  All test cases should pass 
and there should be 0 fails.

Several of the test cases require a directory on the filesystem under 
test for the creation of test files, as well as the generation of 
error conditions.  The test cases assume the directories (or symlinks 
to directories) are as follows:

	testdir/
		- used for general read/write test cases.  Must have at 
		  least as much free space as the machine has RAM (up 
		  to 768MB).
	testdir.enospc/
		- a filesystem that has space for writing 8KB out, but 
		  fails with -ENOSPC beyond 8KB.
	testdir.ext2/
		- must be an ext2 filesystem.
