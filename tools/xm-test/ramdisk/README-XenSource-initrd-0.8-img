XenSource xm-test 0.8 initrd.img
================================

http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-0.8.img is an initrd suitable for
use with Xen's xm-test regression testing suite.  It has been built and
provided by XenSource, for the convenience of Xen users.  xm-test initrds may
be mixed across minor xm-test versions, but not across major versions; this
initrd is suitable for all 0.8.x versions of xm-test (as shipped with Xen
3.0.x >3.0.2-3).

In order to use this initrd, run "./autogen; ./configure; make existing"
inside the xm-test directory, and the initrd will be downloaded automatically.
Alternatively, if you have already downloaded this file, place it into the
xm-test/ramdisk directory and run the same command.  In either case,
runtest.sh can then be used as normal.  See xm-test/README for more details.

This initrd was built using the infrastructure provided by xm-test.  It is a
full guest operating system and filesystem, and as such includes a large
number of pieces of software.  The source code for the majority of these are
included in full inside the file
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-0.8.img-buildroot.tar.bz2, or
alongside this file.  Copyright statements and licences are contained therein.
The remaining source code is included in the Xen distribution, at
http://www.xensource.com/xen/downloads/archives.html.  The configurations used
for BusyBox, uClibc, and Buildroot are available as
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-0.8-busybox-config,
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-0.8-uClibc-config, and
http://xm-test.xensource.com/ramdisks/initrd-0.8-buildroot-config
respectively, or alongside this file.

XenSource and the Xen contributors are grateful to the authors of these
software packages for their contributions to free and open-source software.
