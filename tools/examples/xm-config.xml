This is a configuration file for xm; it should be placed in
/etc/xen/xm-config.xml.  If this file is missing, then xm will fall back to
the normal behaviour that's in Xen 3.0.4 and below.  The settings here are
most useful for experimenting with the Xen-API preview in Xen 3.0.4.

  <!-- The server element describes how to talk to Xend.  The type may be 
       Xen-API or LegacyXMLRPC (the default).  The URI is that of the
       server; you might try http://server:9363/ or
       httpu:///var/run/xend/xen-api.sock for the Xen-API, or
       httpu:///var/run/xend/xmlrpc.sock for the legacy server.

       The username and password attributes will be used to log in if Xen-API
       is being used.
