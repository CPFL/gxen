# Example Python setup script for 'xm create'.
# This script sets the parameters used when a domain is created using 'xm create'.
#
# This is a relatively advanced script that uses a parameter, vmid, to control
# the settings. So this script can be used to start a set of domains by
# setting the vmid parameter on the 'xm create' command line. For example:
#
# xm create vmid=1
# xm create vmid=2
# xm create vmid=3
#
# The vmid is purely a script variable, and has no effect on the the domain
# id assigned to the new domain.
#============================================================================

# Define script variables here.
# xm_vars is defined automatically, use xm_vars.var() to define a variable.

# This function checks that 'vmid' has been given a valid value.
# It is called automatically by 'xm create'.
def vmid_check(var, val):
    val = int(val)
    if val <= 0:
        raise ValueError

# Define the 'vmid' variable so that 'xm create' knows about it.
xm_vars.var('vmid',
            use="Virtual machine id. Integer greater than 0.",
            check=vmid_check)

# WARNING: Creating a domain with insufficient memory may cause out of

# Define the disk devices you want the domain to have access to, and
# what you want them accessible as.
# Each disk entry is of the form phy:UNAME,DEV,MODE
# where UNAME is the device, DEV is the device name the domain will see,
# and MODE is r for read-only, w for read-write.

# This makes the disk device depend on the vmid - assuming
# tHat devices sda7, sda8 etc. exist. The device is exported
# to all domains as sda1.
# All domains get sda6 read-only (to use for /usr, see below).

# Define frame buffer device.
#
# By default, no frame buffer device is configured.
#
# To create one using the SDL backend and sensible defaults:
#
# vfb = [ 'sdl=1' ]
#
# This uses environment variables XAUTHORITY and DISPLAY.  You
# can override that:
#
# vfb = [ 'sdl=1,xauthority=/home/bozo/.Xauthority,display=:1' ]
#
# To create one using the VNC backend and sensible defaults:
#
# vfb = [ 'vnc=1' ]
#
# The backend listens on 127.0.0.1 port 5900+N by default, where N is
# the domain ID.  You can override both address and N:
#
# vfb = [ 'vnc=1,vnclisten=127.0.0.1,vncdisplay=%d' % vmid ]
#
# Or you can bind the first unused port above 5900:
#
# vfb = [ 'vnc=1,vnclisten=0.0.0.0,vncunused=1' ]
#
# You can override the password:
#
# vfb = [ 'vnc=1,vncpasswd=MYPASSWD' ]
#
# Empty password disables authentication.  Defaults to the vncpasswd
# configured in xend-config.sxp.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define to which TPM instance the user domain should communicate.
# The vtpm entry is of the form 'instance=INSTANCE,backend=DOM'
# where INSTANCE indicates the instance number of the TPM the VM
# should be talking to and DOM provides the domain where the backend
# is located.
# Note that no two virtual machines should try to connect to the same
# TPM instance. The handling of all TPM instances does require
# some management effort in so far that VM configration files (and thus
# a VM) should be associated with a TPM instance throughout the lifetime
# of the VM / VM configuration file. The instance number must be
# greater or equal to 1.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Set the kernel command line for the new domain.
# You only need to define the IP parameters and hostname if the domain's
# IP config doesn't, e.g. in ifcfg-eth0 or via DHCP.
# You can use 'extra' to set the runlevel and custom environment
# variables used by custom rc scripts (e.g. VMID=, usr= ).

# Set if you want dhcp to allocate the IP address.

# Configure the behaviour when a domain exits.  There are three 'reasons'
# for a domain to stop: poweroff, reboot, and crash.  For each of these you
# may specify:
#
#   "destroy",        meaning that the domain is cleaned up as normal;
#   "restart",        meaning that a new domain is started in place of the old
#                     one;
#   "preserve",       meaning that no clean-up is done until the domain is
#                     manually destroyed (using xm destroy, for example); or
#   "rename-restart", meaning that the old domain is not cleaned up, but is
#                     renamed and a new domain started in its place.
#
# In the event a domain stops due to a crash, you have the additional options:
#
#   "coredump-destroy", meaning dump the crashed domain's core and then destroy;
#   "coredump-restart', meaning dump the crashed domain's core and the restart.
#
# The default is
#
#   on_poweroff = 'destroy'
#   on_reboot   = 'restart'
#   on_crash    = 'restart'
#
# For backwards compatibility we also support the deprecated option restart
#
# restart = 'onreboot' means on_poweroff = 'destroy'
#                            on_reboot   = 'restart'
#                            on_crash    = 'destroy'
#
# restart = 'always'   means on_poweroff = 'restart'
#                            on_reboot   = 'restart'
#                            on_crash    = 'restart'
#
# restart = 'never'    means on_poweroff = 'destroy'
#                            on_reboot   = 'destroy'
#                            on_crash    = 'destroy'

#   Configure PVSCSI devices:
#
#vscsi=[ 'PDEV, VDEV' ]
#
#   PDEV   gives physical SCSI device to be attached to specified guest
#          domain by one of the following identifier format.
#          - XX:XX:XX:XX (4-tuples with decimal notation which shows
#                          "host:channel:target:lun")
#          - /dev/sdxx or sdx
#          - /dev/stxx or stx
#          - /dev/sgxx or sgx
#          - result of 'scsi_id -gu -s'.
#            ex. # scsi_id -gu -s /block/sdb
#                  36000b5d0006a0000006a0257004c0000
#
#   VDEV   gives virtual SCSI device by 4-tuples (XX:XX:XX:XX) as 
#          which the specified guest domain recognize.
