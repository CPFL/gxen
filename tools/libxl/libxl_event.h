   * if the system, or the Xen components of it, are badly broken.

   * msg and errnoval will describe the action that libxl was trying
   * to do, and type specifies the type of libxl events which may be
   * missing.  type may be 0 in which case events of all types may be
   * missing.
   *
   * disaster may be NULL.  If it is, or if _register_callbacks has
   * not been called, errors of this kind are fatal to the entire

   * libxl calls will return errors; likewise it may be the case that
   * no more events (of the specified type, if applicable) can be
   * produced.  An application which supplies a disaster function
   * should normally react either by exiting, or by (when it has
   * returned to its main event loop) shutting down libxl with
   * libxl_ctx_free and perhaps trying to restart it with
   * libxl_ctx_init.
   *
   * In any case before calling disaster, libxl will have logged a
   * message with level XTL_CRITICAL.
   *
   * Reentrancy: it IS permitted to call libxl from within
   * event_occurs.  It is NOT permitted to call libxl from within
   * disaster.  The event_occurs and disaster callbacks may occur on
   * any thread in which the application calls libxl.
   *
   * libxl_event_register_callbacks may be called as many times, with
   * different parameters, as the application likes; the most recent
   * call determines the libxl behaviour.  However it is NOT safe to
   * call _register_callbacks concurrently with, or reentrantly from,
   * any other libxl function.
   *
   * Calls to _register_callbacks do not affect events which have
   * already occurred.

/*
 * Events are only generated if they have been requested.
 * The following functions request the generation of specific events.
 *
 * Each set of functions for controlling event generation has this form:
 *
 *   typedef struct libxl__evgen_FOO libxl__evgen_FOO;
 *   int libxl_evenable_FOO(libxl_ctx *ctx, FURTHER PARAMETERS,
 *                          libxl_ev_user user, libxl__evgen_FOO **evgen_out);
 *   void libxl_evdisable_FOO(libxl_ctx *ctx, libxl__evgen_FOO *evgen);
 *
 * The evenable function arranges that the events (as described in the
 * doc comment for the individual function) will start to be generated
 * by libxl.  On success, *evgen_out is set to a non-null pointer to
 * an opaque struct.
 *
 * The user value is returned in the generated events and may be
 * used by the caller for whatever it likes.  The type ev_user is
 * guaranteed to be an unsigned integer type which is at least
 * as big as uint64_t and is also guaranteed to be big enough to
 * contain any intptr_t value.
 *
 * If it becomes desirable to stop generation of the relevant events,
 * or to reclaim the resources in libxl associated with the evgen
 * structure, the same evgen value should be passed to the evdisable
 * function.  However, note that events which occurred prior to the
 * evdisable call may still be returned.
 *
 * The caller may enable identical events more than once.  If they do
 * so, each actual occurrence will generate several events to be
 * returned by libxl_event_check, with the appropriate user value(s).
 * Aside from this, each occurrence of each event is returned by
 * libxl_event_check exactly once.
 *
 * An evgen is associated with the libxl_ctx used for its creation.
 * After libxl_ctx_free, all corresponding evgen handles become
 * invalid and must no longer be passed to evdisable.
 *
 * Applications should ensure that they eventually retrieve every
 * event using libxl_event_check or libxl_event_wait, since events
 * which occur but are not retreived by the application will be queued
 * inside libxl indefinitely.  libxl_event_check/_wait may be O(n)
 * where n is the number of queued events which do not match the
 * criteria specified in the arguments to check/wait.

 * OS event handling - passing low-level OS events to libxl
 *
 * Event-driven programs must use these facilities to allow libxl
 * to become aware of readability/writeability of file descriptors
 * and the occurrence of timeouts.

 * simple programs handling reasonably small numbers of domains:
 *

 *          if (r) goto error_out;
 *          do something with the event;

 *   }
 *

 * than _beforepoll/_afterpoll if there are many fds (which can
 * happen if the same libxl application is managing many domains).
 *
 * For an fd event, events is as for poll().  register or modify may
 * be called with events==0, in which case it must still work
 * normally, just not generate any events.
 *
 * For a timeout event, milliseconds is as for poll().
 * Specifically, negative values of milliseconds mean NO TIMEOUT.
 * This is used by libxl to temporarily disable a timeout.
 *
 * If the register or modify hook succeeds it may update

 * int.  The value returned will be passed up through libxl and
 * eventually returned back to the application.  When register
 * fails, any value stored into *for_registration_out is ignored by
 * libxl; when modify fails, any changed value stored into
 * *for_registration_update is honoured by libxl and will be passed
 * to future modify or deregister calls.
 *
 * libxl may want to register more than one callback for any one fd;
 * in that case: (i) each such registration will have at least one bit
 * set in revents which is unique to that registration; (ii) if an
 * event occurs which is relevant for multiple registrations the
 * application's event system may call libxl_osevent_occurred_fd
 * for one, some, or all of those registrations.
 *
 * If fd_modify is used, it is permitted for the application's event
 * system to still make calls to libxl_osevent_occurred_fd for the
 * "old" set of requested events; these will be safely ignored by
 * libxl.
 *
 * libxl will remember the value stored in *for_app_registration_out
 * (or *for_app_registration_update) by a successful call to
 * register (or modify), and pass it to subsequent calls to modify
 * or deregister.
 *
 * osevent_register_hooks may be called only once for each libxl_ctx.
 * libxl may make calls to register/modify/deregister from within
 * any libxl function (indeed, it will usually call register from
 * register_event_hooks).  Conversely, the application MUST NOT make
 * the event occurrence calls (libxl_osevent_occurred_*) into libxl
 * reentrantly from within libxl (for example, from within the
 * register/modify functions).
 *
 * Lock hierarchy: the register/modify/deregister functions may be
 * called with locks held.  These locks (the "libxl internal locks")
 * are inside the libxl_ctx.  Therefore, if those register functions
 * acquire any locks of their own ("caller register locks") outside
 * libxl, to avoid deadlock one of the following must hold for each
 * such caller register lock:
 *  (a) "acquire libxl internal locks before caller register lock":
 *      No libxl function may be called with the caller register
 *      lock held.
 *  (b) "acquire caller register lock before libxl internal locks":
 *      No libxl function may be called _without_ the caller
 *      register lock held.
 * Of these we would normally recommend (a).

/*
 * Subprocess handling.
 *
 * Unfortunately the POSIX interface makes this very awkward.
 *
 * There are two possible arrangements for collecting statuses from
 * wait/waitpid.
 *
 * For naive programs:
 *
 *     libxl will keep a SIGCHLD handler installed whenever it has an
 *     active (unreaped) child.  It will reap all children with
 *     wait(); any children it does not recognise will be passed to
 *     the application via an optional callback (and will result in
 *     logged warnings if no callback is provided or the callback
 *     denies responsibility for the child).
 *
 *     libxl may have children whenever:
 *
 *       - libxl is performing an operation which can be made
 *         asynchronous; ie one taking a libxl_asyncop_how, even
 *         if NULL is passed indicating that the operation is
 *         synchronous; or
 *
 *       - events of any kind are being generated, as requested
 *         by libxl_evenable_....
 *
 *     A multithreaded application which is naive in this sense may
 *     block SIGCHLD on some of its threads, but there must be at
 *     least one thread that has SIGCHLD unblocked.  libxl will not
 *     modify the blocking flag for SIGCHLD (except that it may create
 *     internal service threads with all signals blocked).
 *
 *     A naive program must only have at any one time only
 *     one libxl context which might have children.
 *
 * For programs which run their own children alongside libxl's:
 *
 *     A program which does this must call libxl_childproc_setmode.
 *     There are two options:
 * 
 *     libxl_sigchld_owner_mainloop:
 *       The application must install a SIGCHLD handler and reap (at
 *       least) all of libxl's children and pass their exit status
 *       to libxl by calling libxl_childproc_exited.
 *
 *     libxl_sigchld_owner_libxl_always:
 *       The application expects libxl to reap all of its children,
 *       and provides a callback to be notified of their exit
 *       statues.
 *
 * An application which fails to call setmode, or which passes 0 for
 * hooks, while it uses any libxl operation which might
 * create or use child processes (see above):
 *   - Must not have any child processes running.
 *   - Must not install a SIGCHLD handler.
